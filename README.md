# Forkful Meal Planner

Welcome to the Forkful Meal Planner, a minimalist and easy-to-use meal planner web application. This app allows the user to create recipes and plan meals to aid in the efficient preparation of delicious foods.

This project is being completed for the CS 361 course at Oregon State University.

# Implementation Notes

Currently, the UI for the application fetched data from a single API service. In future versions, this single service will be adapted to a microservice architecture. But for now, you can access the temporary monolithic service at https://github.com/mjande/forkful-meal-planner-api-temp.
